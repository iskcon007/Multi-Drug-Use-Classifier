DrugX-Predictor 🔬💊 A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Regular and Non-Regular Drug Users**
This project analyzes patterns in drug consumption behavior and uses machine learning models to predict whether an individual is a regular or non-regular user. It aims to raise awareness of the health risks associated with substance abuse and provide a data-driven tool for early identification and prevention efforts.
📌 Project Title Poisoning the Body, Destroying the Mind: The Alarming Health Toll of Drug Consumption – A Machine Learning Approach**
🧠 Project Objective To develop a classification model that predicts drug usage behavior (regular or non-regular) based on demographic and personality traits.
